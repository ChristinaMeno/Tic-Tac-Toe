New and improved TTT challenge.
I will write a daemon that sits on a socket visible to the internet.
This is the protocol that I will communicate with.

request a new game:
{"sha1": "44475cf57725c5a988a27cebe6e79a8bbf732f85"}

response is one of:
{"game_state": [], "sha1": "44475cf57725c5a988a27cebe6e79a8bbf732f85"}
{"game_state": [opening_move,], "sha1": "44475cf57725c5a988a27cebe6e79a8bbf732f85"} where opening move is a offset described below

#TODO I considered making the state represented by a concatination of the offsets converted to hex, just to make it a little harder.
